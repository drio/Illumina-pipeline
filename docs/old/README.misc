HGSC_SLX MISC

== parse_tab.rb ==
This script will take delimited file for slx, parse the fields and populate to
the slx lims database.  The fields will have to be specified in the order as
from this file "/data/slx/goats/hgsc_slx/templates/fields.txt".

Usage:
  parse_tab.rb input_file

Note: The script is current set to only output the commands to populate the
stats in slx lims.  You will still have to run the code.
