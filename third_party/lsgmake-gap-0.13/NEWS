Version 0.13
  - Added --bsub-options command-line option to allow passing of
    arbitrary command-line options to all bsub commands.
  - Added --id command-line option to allow creation of process-unique
    LSF jobs names to avoid difficulties with JOB_DEP_LAST_SUB.

Version 0.12
  - Changed default job dependency from ended() to done() and added
    --status command-line option to allow user to override default.
  - Added support for new Bustard targets in GAPipeline-1.3.
  - Added automatic support for auto-calibration in GAPipeline-1.3+.
  - Fixed bug where making a specific target did not respect
    --dependency command-line option.
  - Changed so "all" targets are performed single threaded to work
    around bug in make triggered by GERALD Makefile.
  - Simplified bsub command by only including necessary options.

Version 0.11
  - Improved handling of job arrays including removing a bug
    introduced that caused problems with Firecrest directories with
    commas (old-style, paired-end Firecrest directories).

  - Default number of jobs spawned in parallel is now one (was two).

Version 0.9
  - Take advantage of LSF job arrays when submitting per lane jobs.

Version 0.8
  - Added --queue option to allow submission to a specific LSF queue.

  - Reduced parallelization of make to the same number of job slots
    (use to be one greater).

  - Changed LSF job dependency from done() to ended().

Version 0.7
  - Same as version 0.1 (lsgmake --version reported 0.7 in 0.1)

Version 0.1
  - Put in workaround for GERALD Makefile bug neglecting the proper
    dependency on tiles.txt (found by Tom Skelly <ts6@sanger.ac.uk>).

  - Renamed to lsgmake-gap.

  - Added the -j command-line option, allowing a user-configurable number
    of jobs per node.

  - Added the -R command-line option, allowing arbitrary resource
    specifications to be passed to the bsub command.

  - Removed the --x86 command-line option (-R is more flexible).
